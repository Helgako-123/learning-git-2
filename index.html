        <h1>Shape of my heart</h1>
        <h2>by Sting</h2>
        <p>He deals the cards as a meditation<br>
            And those he plays never suspect<br>
            He doesn't play for the money he wins<br>
            He don't play for respect
        </p>
        <p>He deals the cards to find the answer<br>
            The sacred geometry of chance<br>
            The hidden law of a probable outcome<br>
            The numbers lead a dance
        </p>
        <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
            I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
            I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
            But that's not the shape of my heart
        </p>
        <p>He may play the jack of diamonds<br>
            He may lay the queen of spades<br>
            He may conceal a king in his hand<br>
            While the memory of it fades
        </p>
        <p>I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
            I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
            I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
            But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
            That's not the shape<br>
            The shape of my heart
        </p>
